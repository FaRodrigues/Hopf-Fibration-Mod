# Discrete Hopf-Fibration Modulations
This project is dedicated to the use of Discrete Hopf Fibration in the design of Four-Dimensional Modulations

The formalism of Hopf fibration can be useful in the context of classical coherent optical communications.
Hopf maps can provide complementary information on the geometry of four-dimensional signal space through explicit and concise relations.
Using the sampled discrete Hopf fibration, we can design dense 4D modulations called nPolSK-mQAM, where n is related to the number of base space points and m is related to the number of samples obtained over a uniform angular distribution of points over Hopf fibres.
