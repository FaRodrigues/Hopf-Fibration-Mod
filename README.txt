About the Wolfram Mathematica code

The main part of the functions presented here was implemented using Wolfram Mathematica software. To use this code it is necessary to install the two packages, named respectively:

* "HopfFibrationFunctions.m";
* "PerformanceMetricFunctions.m".

These packages are hard coded for simplicity, so improvements in the script could be necessary.

To facilitate the verification of the installation, we provided a notebook script called "CheckInstall.nb" This script list the packages installed on your Mathematica software and, based on this, the script search for the name of the companion packages.

So, after install the companion packages, please run the "CheckInstall.nb" script to verify the installation.
